// 1. Create two variables, a and b, and assign them integer values (e.g., 8 and 3).

// 2. Perform the following operations using a and b, and store the results in separate variables:
// - Add the values (sum).
// - Subtract b from a (difference).
// - Multiply the values (product).
// - Divide a by b (quotient).
// - Find the remainder when a is divided by b (remainder).

//3. Use console.log() to print the results of each operation. For example, print: "The sum of a and b is: 11"
